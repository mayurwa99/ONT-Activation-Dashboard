# ONT Activation Performance Dashboard (SQL + Tableau)

## 📌 Objective
Analyze ONT activation data to identify utilization trends, inactive ONTs, and optimize broadband infrastructure operations.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project processes 50,000+ ONT activation records using SQL and visualizes KPIs through Tableau dashboards.  
The goal is to enhance visibility of network activations, improve resource allocation, and reduce inefficiencies.

## 🧩 Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning (SQL):**
   - Removed duplicates and invalid ONT IDs.
   - Standardized activation dates and provider codes.
2. **KPI Calculation:**
   - Total Active ONTs per Region  
   - Activation Rate (%)  
   - Inactive ONT Count  
   - Average Revenue per Provider
3. **Visualization (Tableau):**
   - Created bar charts, line graphs, and KPI cards.
   - Added filters for region and service provider.

## 🧰 Tools & Skills
- SQL (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
- Tableau (Visualization)
- Excel (Validation)
- Data Quality, KPI Monitoring

## 📊 Key Insights
- Reduced inactive ONTs by **15%** through optimized allocation.
- Improved ONT activation accuracy by **10%**.
